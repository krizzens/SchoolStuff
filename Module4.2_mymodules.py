create_time: This function should create a time object and return it.
output_local_time: This function should receive a time object as a parameter and display the local_time associated with it.
calculate_difference: This function should receive two objects, subtract them from each other and return the difference.
generate_random: This function receives a maximum number as a parameter and then returns a random number between 0 and the maximum number. """
