There should also be a count field that keeps track of the number of firefighters in the system. All firefighter instance variables/attributes should be initialised in the class constructor. The total number of firefighters should also be incremented in the class constructor.

# Create a script called firehouse.py. In this script, you must import the firefighter's module and create at least three different firefighters. Display the details of the three firefighters to the console window along with the total number of firefighters created (using a class variable).
