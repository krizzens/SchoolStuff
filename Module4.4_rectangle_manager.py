Ask the user to enter the details of rectangles, i.e. a length, width and display_character for each rectangle. The user should be able to enter as many rectangles as they wish. As each rectangle is created, store the created rectangles in a list. Once the user is happy that they have created enough rectangles, they should be allowed to stop entering rectangles. The script should then display the details of each saved rectangle to the console window.
