These variables should be initialised in the constructor. The rectangle should have a method called calculate_area() for calculating and returning its area and a method called display, which will display the length and width of the rectangle and its area. This method should also draw the rectangle to screen using the display_character, e.g. for a rectangle with a length of 6, the width of 3 and a display_character of *; it will look as follows:

# ******
# ******
# ******
